// headings are laid out in a column. By the time its height has been
// reduced to kAppBarMidHeight, its layout is horizontal, only one section
// heading is visible, and the section's list of details is visible below the
// heading. The appbar's height can be reduced to no more than kAppBarMinHeight.
